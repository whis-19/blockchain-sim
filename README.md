# Zakat Blockchain Simulation

A comprehensive blockchain simulation system designed to demonstrate the deduction and distribution of Zakat (2.5%) through secure and immutable transactions. Each student acts as an independent node in the blockchain system with a default starting balance of 200 coins.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete blockchain system from scratch in Python, using only fundamental data structures (lists and dictionaries) without any external blockchain or cryptographic libraries. The system simulates religious financial obligations through blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, traceability, and immutability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Blockchain Structure
- **Proper Data Model**: Uses Python dictionaries and lists for blockchain implementation
- **Block Components**: Each block contains transactions, hash, previous hash, timestamp, and roll number seed key
- **Genesis Block**: Automatic creation of the first block in the chain

### Hashing & Security
- **Roll Number Seed Key**: Student roll numbers are used as seed keys in hash functions
- **Unique Hash Generation**: Ensures uniqueness and prevents hash collisions across multiple students
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Secure hash algorithm for block integrity

### Zakat Calculation
- **Automatic 2.5% Deduction**: Religious financial obligation automatically calculated
- **Dual Transaction System**: Separate transactions for transfer and zakat deduction
- **Special Zakat Account**: Dedicated account for collecting zakat funds

### Transaction History
- **Complete Ledger**: Maintains full transaction history with timestamps
- **Traceability**: Every transaction is recorded with sender, receiver, amount, and zakat details
- **Transparency**: All transaction data is accessible and verifiable

### Block Validation & Immutability
- **Hash Verification**: Automatic verification of block hashes
- **Chain Integrity**: Ensures no tampering with previous blocks
- **Immutability Check**: Any modification invalidates the blockchain
- **Blockchain State Validation**: Transactions validated against entire blockchain history

### Modularity
- **Clear Function Structure**: Well-organized functions and classes
- **Reusable Logic**: Modular design for easy maintenance and extension
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct modules for different functionalities

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Web Interface (Streamlit)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open a web interface in your browser where you can:
- Create student accounts with roll numbers
- Perform transactions with automatic zakat calculation
- Mine blocks and view the blockchain
- Validate chain integrity
- View complete transaction history

#### Command Line Interface
   ```bash
python cli.py
```
This provides a command-line interface with the following commands:
- `create <name> <balance> <roll_no>` - Create a new account
- `transfer <sender> <receiver> <amount>` - Perform a transaction
- `mine` - Mine pending transactions
- `accounts` - Show all accounts
- `blockchain` - Show blockchain
- `history` - Show transaction history
- `validate` - Validate blockchain
- `demo` - Run demonstration mode
- `help` - Show available commands
- `exit` - Exit the program

## Usage Examples

### Creating Student Accounts
Each student node starts with a default balance of 200 coins:

```python
# Web Interface: Use the "Create Account" page
# CLI: create Alice 200.0 2023001
```

### Performing Transactions
Transactions automatically calculate and deduct 2.5% zakat:

```python
# Web Interface: Use the "Make Transaction" page
# CLI: transfer Alice Bob 50.0
# Result: Bob receives $50.0, Zakat_Account receives $1.25 (2.5% of $50.0)
```

### Mining Blocks
Blocks are mined using the sender's roll number as the seed key:

```python
# Web Interface: Use the "Mine Block" page
# CLI: mine
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Block Structure
```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, transactions, prev_hash, roll_no):
        self.transactions = transactions
        self.timestamp = time.time()
        self.roll_no = roll_no  # Seed key for uniqueness
        self.prev_hash = prev_hash
        self.hash = self.compute_hash()
```

### Zakat Calculation
```python
def calculate_zakat(amount):
    """Calculate zakat (2.5% of the amount)"""
    return amount * 0.025
```

### Hash Generation
```python
def compute_hash(self):
    """Compute SHA-256 hash using roll number as seed key"""
    block_data = {
        'transactions': self.transactions,
        'timestamp': self.timestamp,
        'roll_no': self.roll_no,
        'prev_hash': self.prev_hash
    }
    block_string = json.dumps(block_data, sort_keys=True)
    seed_string = f"{block_string}_{self.roll_no}"
    return hashlib.sha256(seed_string.encode()).hexdigest()
```
